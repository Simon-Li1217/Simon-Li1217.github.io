I am currently a second-year master's student at the [TJU Smart IoT Laboratory](https://smartiotlab.net/Home), advised by Prof. [Tie Qiu](https://smartiotlab.net/Team). My research focuses on the robust optimization of IoT topologies in smart cities, aiming to enhance the reliability and efficiency of urban IoT networks. I currently have one conference paper and one journal paper under submission.

I am passionate about back-end development and system architecture design. With a solid programming foundation and extensive practical experience in projects, I continuously keep pace with cutting-edge technologies such as machine learning and AIGC. I am actively seeking **summer internship** opportunities. For more details, please refer to my resume. Feel free to reach out to me at [lijiqiao@tju.edu.cn](mailto:lijiqiao@tju.edu.cn) or [jasql1217@gmail.com](mailto:jasql1217@gmail.com), or connect with me on WeChat (ID: L937597275).
