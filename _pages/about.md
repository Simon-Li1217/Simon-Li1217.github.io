I am currently a second-year master's student at the [TJU Smart IoT Laboratory](https://smartiotlab.net/Home), advised by Prof.  [Tie Qiu](https://smartiotlab.net/Team). My current research focuses on the robust optimization of IoT topologies in smart cities. Currently, I have one conference paper and one journal paper under submission.

My research interests primarily focus on *graph data mining**, **graph-based decision models**, and **social network analysis**. I am passionate about exploring the essence of the world within vast amounts of data. I am highly self-motivated and deeply enthusiastic about research in artificial intelligence and data science.

I am actively seeking **research assistant** and **PhD** opportunities to further my academic journey. For more details, please refer to my resume. Feel free to reach out to me at lijiqiao@tju.edu.cn & jasql1217@gmail.com, or on WeChat (ID: L937597275).
